            Puto Bumbong : Recipe
            <p class="p">
                Puto bumbong is a type of Filipino purple rice cake which is prepared 
by steaming ground purple rice mixture inside a bamboo tube. The 
tube is referred to as “bumbong ng kawayan” in Filipino. This might 
have been the reason why this was named as such. Puto bumbong has 
been associated with the Christmas season…

            Instructions
            <p class="p">
1. Combine all types of rice in a large mixing bowl. Pour water. Soak for 2 
days.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
2. Drain the water by pouring the contents of the bowl into a large sieve.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
                3. Put the soaked rice in a large food processor. Start to grind the rice until 
it becomes very fine. Note: It took me around 10 minutes to achieve this 
consistency.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
             4. Fill your puto bumbong steamer with water halfway through. Apply heat 
            and then let the water boil.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
            5. Meanwhile, fill each bumbong (bamboo tube) with powdered rice. Note: 
            Do not compress the rice so that steam can pass easily.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
            6. Once the water starts to boil rapidly, arrange each bamboo tube on the 
            steamer. Continue to cook until steam comes out of the tube.
            </p><p class="p">
            7. Remove the tube from the steamer. Arrange the contents over a piece 
            of banana leaf. Spread butter all over and then top with freshly grated 
            coconut and muscovado sugar.
            </p>
            <p class="p">
            8. Serve. Share and enjoy!
