            Puto Bumbong?
            <p class="p">
                Puto bumbong is a type of Filipino purple rice cake which is 
                prepared by steaming ground purple rice mixture inside a bamboo tube. 
                The tube is referred to as “bumbong ng kawayan” in Filipino.
                 This might have been the reason why this was named as such.
            </p>      
            
            <p class="p">
                Puto bumbong has been associated with the Christmas season 
                because it is mostly sold outside the church during the traditional simbang gabi. 
                The puto bumbong vendor can be observed steaming a powdered concoction inside a bamboo tube using an odd shaped steamer. 
                The steamed rice cake is then placed on a piece of pre-cut banana leaf and then topped with margarine (or butter),
                 freshly grated coconut, and muscovado sugar.

                This puto bumbong recipe is the best that we can come-up with when trying to capture 
                the good old traditional puto bumbong back in the days, 
                when the vendors were not yet using purple yam (ube) as an alternative ingredient.
            </p>

            <p class="p">
                The color of traditional puto bumbong should come from the rice. 
                Food coloring is not necessary. 
                The rice should also give it a subtle nice taste, which will later be enhanced by the toppings. 
                This is the reason why a generous amount of butter or margarine is necessary, and the freshest grated coconut is recommended. M
                uscovado sugar, which is a type of partially refined sugar, 
                helps a lot to make your puto bumbong taste good and authentic.
            </p><p class="p">
                Pirurutung or sticky purple rice is the main ingredient of this treat. 
                Traditionally, the rice is soaked in water along with other rice varieties and then ground in a grinder made of solid stone. 
                This recipe makes use of this type of rice along with malagkit (glutinous rice), and long grain purple rice. Instead of a grinding stone, 
                I used a food processor to grind the soaked rice. 
                My wife Dey and myself played with different variations of the recipe, and this is the best as far as our testing goes. 
                This is how we remember how the puto bumbong looked and tasted like when we were still kids.

            <pc class="p">
                Before trying to make your puto bumbong, 
                make sure that you have the necessary equipment 
                such as the steamer and the bamboo tubes. 
                Note that this is best eaten hot, so dont delay. 
                Enjoy your puto bumbong. Merry Christmas!

                My name is Carl Daniel lacerna. I live in the Navotas City of Philippine. 
I created this Filipino food blog, Puto Bumbong : Recipe, to share my 
best Filipino and Asian recipes to everyone. As huge fan of the Filipino 
way of cooking, it is my goal to teach people how to cook Filipino 
dishes using the simplest way possible. I am not a chef nor 
professional cook or baker nor have I attended formal training for 
cooking and baking. I am just a regular student WHO LIKES FOOD and 
enjoys preparing them!!! The recipes you will find here are either those 
that were passed down to me from my mother, grandmother and 
friends and from internet but a bit altered due to ingredient 
constraints or personal taste and sometimes from eating out and 
trying to copy the food using only instincts and taste buds (trial and 
error method).
